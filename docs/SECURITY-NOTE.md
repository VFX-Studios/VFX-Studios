Read-only master assets
-----------------------
- The following files are designated master references and must not be edited directly:
  - docs/laser-product-report-template.md
  - functions/metadata-schema.ts
  - scripts/serve-with-csp.mjs

Handling rules
- Do not modify these files in place; create a copy if you need variations.
- Keep file attributes read-only (set with `attrib +R` on Windows).
- Treat contents as proprietary; distribute only sanitized copies.

If you must update:
- Propose changes via a copy and review; then replace the master in a controlled change with approval.
